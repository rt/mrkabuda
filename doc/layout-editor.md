# Layout Editor

The layout editor allows you to build the qmk firmware for a keyboard online.

### key-config

Key configs are shared for layout-editor, layout-analyzes, and the physical build.

**layout-editor propeties**

```clojure
```

### Layers

Probably just follow your keymaps in qmk ...

### Firmware

A fork of qmk_firmware is needed to have default keyboard configs ready to be swapped.
It the server would write the file and compile returning the image.
